	<blockquote>Quote: <p>prisoner
 system that makes it possible for an attacked unit to have a sort of
surrendering animation in the middle of the fight (which I think was
tied up to the amount of HP / morale that remains for that unit</p></blockquote>
Thanks,
 that's what we plan while we take the distance into account. So if
there are many fit enemy units around a single hero, then even that one
will get captured if the encirclement is close enough unless the loyalty
/ sympathy is high / low to the friends / capturers.
</p>
<p>
Females as they have less health-points will get captured easily even
from a distance. The weaker a unit the earlier (closer distance) it will
 surrender, becoming a neutral unit that follows the unit that captured.
 This unit now only can capture more units for as long as the own health
 is higher than the altogether health of all captives.
</p>
<p>
Then the unit might go home, taking the captives away.</p><p>
This way, if a well aimed javelin hurts the capturer that has already
many captives, then probably one of them can break out, the fittest in
this case.
</p>
<p>
The cool thing is, in 0 A.D. this is not limited to soldiers .. you can
even catch a fox or crododile like that. Beware that crododiles attack
your units, if you should lose control over one of them while having
them as a captive nearby.
</p>
<p>
Once we have the possibility to place eye-candy objects (like fences) then we can fence the captives.
</p>
<p>
For animals a corral was planned and there is a patch around that makes
animals be tied to the corrals. It's even possible to have them inside
the building. Though I like the fence thing better as then we don't have
 to prop extra animals to the stable object. And they would still be
attackable/freeable. It's more realistic than first to have to destroy
the building down to 25% .. especially if you just had to jump over the
fence to get the horse out.
<img src="Functionality_Ideas_and_their_Status_files/default_smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>
<p>
Good you mention the morale. We need it for the military anyway, so way
not adding this too for every unit. If a formation has overrun other
units, then moral would increase and even if they meet a stronger unit
then, they could hold out longer due to the initial morale being high
while it's decreasing more and more as long as they have more losses
than the enemy, lose ground or are heavily overpowered. We have
flexibility here.
</p>
<p>
As we already have to execute range check for picking attack targets in
the battle, then we could even make units nearby to a loss more affected
 than those far away. This could lead to a partly dissolving army if
they encounter elite units at a certain part of the front.</p><p>
Perhaps we should not even store morale at all having it at 50% instead
and deriving the + and - through a calculation that takes all nearby
factors into account. Later we can add that bad news from another army
has influence into the formula depending on time, the news was received
by the unit.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>Quote: <p>Maybe
 we can have a sort of eye-candy family created whenever there is a
certain number of houses present, and then, have each house spawn
children who then grows up to become (free of cost villagers) - sort of
the peasants of Stronghold.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Interesting! You sparked another idea, we could create an optional vasall system too.
</p>
<p>
The free of cost is good idea. I think it would be cool to not allow
instant units at all. The exception are the mercenaries. They are
getting much more interesting this way too.
</p>
<p>
Each map could have either infinite mercenaries available. Or we limit
it to eye-candy mini-cultures that of course could also go extinct if
too many mercenaries are drawn (it's possible they also send mercenaries
 to other tribes, e.g. the AI, perhaps we should add a tech for allowing
 to force the mini-cultures to not send mercenaries to other units. Of
course the enemy will get a message and could use your takeover of the
mini-civ as a reason for war.).
</p>
<p>
The cost for the units would be the school and grow-up then. Also the
food and water they consume will be pricy. They need leather too. Iron
later once they become soldiers if they decide to apply for the posts
that are written out of the mayor/government.
</p>
<p>
So if you decide to recruit all you have in an emergency (raising alert
the second time, e.g.), then you might well lose your teachers too.
Could still send a general or other elite instead. Of course you don't
have to send the teachers in yourself. We could add a button that
decides if only teachers are teachers or all other elite units too.
</p>
<p>
I wish to avoud having it all hard-coded, I like it if it's flexible.
</p>
<p>
As we introduce time (somewhere I calculated 1 world-day will take 60
minutes by default) we will have a quite realistic feeling. The flow of
time can be increased. just like it is currently.
</p>
<p>
Of course this open the problem of overreproduction, so this could lead
to send your units abroad to populate an island or to conquer new
territory. This might also trigger an AI to lead an preventive attack
before the enemy gets too strong.
</p>
<p>
Good you mention stronghold, I hope we will have a similar building-damage system soon.
Time will tell us how to achieve it.
</p>

<blockquote>shieldwolf said: <p>Let
 me add on the mercenaries  -  if a map will have infinite mercenaries,
then in time, there should be a sort - of either an assimilation of
cultures or total rebellion/ defeat of the culture who hired the
mercenaries (something akin to what happened with the Late Western Roman
 Empire).</p>
</blockquote>
Though we planned rebellion with the
Hybrid AI, I did not think of this usecase!! glorious, colleague! That
must go on our list.
<p>
The mercenary count will be examined taking their
 loyalty to the tribe/player that hired them into account. So the
formula will be something like: mercenary_rebellion_probability_0..100 =  1 -  (<strong>moral</strong>  + <strong>loyalty_towards_those_who_hired_them) / (morale.max + loyalty.max)</strong>
</p>
<p>
where
</p>
<p>
<strong>moral</strong> is already affected by military success and health, so health must not go into the calculation explicitely.
</p>
<p>
<strong>loyalty_towards_those_who_hired_them</strong>
 is a property of each unit that comes with the Hybrid AI. (we should
discuss if additionally each unit has
sympathy_towards_other_tribes_or_players. The units already have plenty
have plenty of sympathy values to store, i.e. for all elite unit and all
 direct and indirect chiefs. We can't include every unit probably, but
we can test if hardware can handle it to store sympathy of a peasant
towards another peasant. would be cool indeed to add additional
battlefield possibilities like, ha, I abandon this comrad and help this.
 You see. Or I help this woman and I marry her if she feels the same. I
think you get the idea. We could make this moddable so that forced
marriage might be possible for other cultures.)</p><p><strong>they_will_be_loyal</strong>
 is a factor, usually 100 . Might be lowered for mercenaries that are
known to not be very reliable. could be read from the units XML-file as
an optional property.
</p>
<p>
Note: If we use floating point, then each
factor has to be divided by 100. Then the probability would be between
0..1 just like it's formally correct as a probability is always between 0
 and 1. (not that you accuse me I teach wrong things, what I probably do
 anyway.)
</p>
<blockquote>Quote: <p>On
 overreproduction, may I suggest though that the children spawning be
tied up to a certain number of houses so that if like, 20 houses are
reached with 20 children, no more children is spawned. Something like
that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are you sure it's tied to houses in nature?
hm.. Perhaps it is. So probably each house a number maximum people and
others (children grown up) then have to live on the streets/ inthe woods
 .. lowering their moral and increasing their will to become hired as
mercenary of other tribes. Or join the military if any new soldiers are
wanted (what might not be the case. The moral will sink and sink ... and
 they will start being like Robin Hood, finally even changing clothes to

If I am remembered of this tragedy of failing commanders then I get quite
upset. Really throughout history things are happening that are difficult
 to grasp from our informed position:
 <blockquote>
 	 <ul>
 	 	 <li>
 	 	 	 They said: <em>Celts and Avar, only the fittest are allowed to take shelter in the Roman Empire. All elderly are left to the huns.</em>
 	 	 </li>
 	 	 <li>
 	 	 	 Emperor: <em>You are allowed to settle here.</em>
 	 	 </li>
 	 	 <li>
 	 	 	 Local praefect: <em>You are no longer allowed to settle here.</em>
 	 	 </li>
 	 	 <li>
 	 	 	 Emperor: <em>You want to settle? Well, you are not allowed to settle anywhere, you can cross the danube if you like the huns.</em>
 	 	 </li>
 	 	 <li>
 	 	 	 Awar: <em>How do come to say that, then we take the land we want. Try to stop us.</em>
 	 	 </li>
 	 	 <li>
 	 	 	 Emperor: <em>Call the armies. I lead one myself.</em>
 	 	 </li>
 	 	 <li>
 	 	 	 General victorious against a small cohort of Avar.
 	 	 </li>
 	 	 <li>
 	 	 	 Emperor:  <em>You see, it's easy.</em>
 	 	 </li>
 	 	 <li>
 	 	 	 Another
 General victorious in France/Germany against celts. They try to help
the others, because there are plenty of Avars. They have a long way.
		 </li>
		 <li>
		 	 Emperor: <em>Oh, all are winning. Well, it's easy. I will show.</em> To General: <em>Is my army ready?</em>
		 </li>
		 <li>
		 	 General:  <em>We better wait for the others.</em>
		 </li>
		 <li>
		 	 Emperor: <em>You maybe. Me certainly not.</em>
		 </li>
		 <li>
		 	 General: <em>Awk... Okay.</em>
		 </li>
		 <li>
		 	 Emperor and General both dead after they underestimated the number of gothic tribespeople.
		 </li>
		 <li>
		 	 Ha, nothing else than free way to destroy everything for the now certainly angry tribes.
		 </li>
	 </ul>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
 And the bad thing is, those stories never end. Just recently another example came up in real world.
 </p>
 <p>
 Okay. Back to topic. That re-sparked another idea I almost forgot:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
 	 <li>
 	 	 Technological
 advances will spread. So neighbouring celtic and other tribes will gain
 knowledge if a high-tech country is nearby. Even far-away will have
influence, so that it's at no time possible to have knights at one half
of the world and spaceships on the other. (at least no majorities, local
 ancient tribes are fine)
 	 </li>
 </ul>

<p></p>
<p>
Self-awareness of
units: So if a unit is idle, well then I look there, the tavern for some
 time, perhaps depending on the number of units nearby. If there are too
 many, go elsewhere. Perhaps fishing.
</p>
<p>
Should be random. Could be location oriented too.
</p>
<p>
If an idle unit is nearby a lot of fish or a fisherman it might sit down
 nearby under a tree, watching the fisherman - at least until it's dark.
 Then all units go home and light is kindled.
