0BC Time Machine
======

Anti-war 0AD\* fork\*\*, rewrite\*\*\* for simplicity, performance and unlimited possibilities. (In contrast to 0AD the engine features won't be restricted just because the main game doesn't have a need for it, e.g. day night cycles, weather, roads, structures equality and more.)

\*    *0AD is a pitched battle war game, where disturbingly females have been slaughtered by dead material walls. 0BC's goal is anti-war propaganda, education and civil adventure, because undoubtedly instead of waiting as soldiers in the trenches for death or storming into arrow or bullet rain we prefer an epic world of variation, magic and adventure.*

\*\*  *Some 0AD modules are simply forked, of those some are equal to the same module in 0AD, some are modifications.*

\*\*\* *Many 0BC modules are either completely rewritten or new.*

Game Engine Clarification
---
* 0 B.C. Time Machine (game) is modular. Few modules are based on 0 A.D. (clearly denoted as such).
* 0 B.C.'s engine forked from pyrogenesis. The engine has partly been rewritten, some modules are added. The long term development unrelates 0BC.pyrogenesis from 0AD.pyrogenesis and approaches Blender's simulation mode in completely new hybrid engine, aimed at combining Unreal Engine's and pyrogenesis's advantages.
* 0 B.C.'s scenario editor is an independent development and unrelated to 0 A.D..
